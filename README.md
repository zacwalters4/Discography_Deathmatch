## Abstract

Discography Deathmatch is a TypeScript/React application designed to allow users to pit their favorite artist's albums against eachother to find their favorite album. A user can search for an artist, and is then presented with a battle screen of the artist's top 10 albums . Users can then select their prefered album out of the current 2 displayed, eliminating the other from the contest. The winning albums are then stored in the collection page.

## To-Do
1. Improve useability for smaller screen sizes (especially mobile devices)
2. Improve accessability
3. E2E Cypress Testing
4. Animations!
