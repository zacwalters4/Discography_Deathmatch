## Abstract

Discography Deathmatch is a TypeScript/React application designed to allow users to pit their favorite artist's albums against eachother to find their favorite album. A user can search for an artist, and is then presented with a battle screen of the artist's top 10 albums . Users can then select their prefered album out of the current 2 displayed, eliminating the other from the contest.

- Work within constraints to deliver a product for your niche audience, which helps solve a problem unique to them.
- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list, searching, commenting, etc
- Multiple views handled by Router
- Be deployed using Heroku, Surge, or any other similar service
